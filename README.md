# üå± Kodbanken ‚Äì Branch Out

Welcome to **Kodbanken ‚Äì Branch Out**, a React-based job portal for developers. Here you can explore open positions, filter them by tech stack, and commit to your next career step. üöÄ

## üîç Project overview

The task was to build a custom job portal using [Arbetsf√∂rmedlingens JobSearch API](https://jobsearch.api.jobtechdev.se/), with a focus on structured data fetching, clean React architecture, routing, and consistent styling using Arbetsf√∂rmedlingen's design system (@digi/arbetsformedlingen-react).

The application makes it easier for developers to:

- Find jobs based on their stack (Frontend, Backend, Fullstack)
- Search and filter jobs based on keywords and location
- Read detailed job ads, including deadlines and employer info
- Navigate seamlessly across pages with a clean, responsive UI powered by React Router and accessible design.

## ‚ú® Features

**Landing page ("/")**

- Welcomes users and provides quick access to job categories.

**Occupation pages ("/frontend", "/backend", "/fullstack", "/all")**

- Lists available job ads fetched from the JobSearch API
- Provides filtering based on occupation category.

**Search & filters**

- Free-text search input for job titles and descriptions
- Geolocation filter: find jobs near your location or within a chosen radius.

- Job ads are displayed 25 per page with navigation for more results.

**Single job ad page ("/:occupationSlug/:id")**

- Detailed view of a job ad, including description, deadlines and employer info.
- Direct apply button ("Commit ans√∂kan üòâ").

**About page ("/om-oss")**

**Context + Reducer for state management**
